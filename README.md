# SQLStartupFSM

FSM(Finite State Machine) is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. 

In this repo, we used a simple .NET core-based console FSM to demonstrate SQL Start up state transition.

## Using SQLStartupFSM

You can simply `git clone` this project to get started. It is recommended that you don't preserve history of the project (it isn't generally meaningful) for your repo, but make a copy and `git init` your project from source.

## Building

You don't "build" New Repo, however, this will be meaningful for many other projects.
